Date: April 30th, 2017

Abstract
This program can brute force a string that is encrypted with a ceasar cipher using a dictionary of most common words

In Depth
1) Take in an encrypted string through a text box
2) Pass the string into a function that determines the key based on which shift creates a sentence with the most words
3) String is passed into another function that fully decrypts the string and includes all symbols that aren't in the alphabet
4) Decrypted string and key used are displayed on screen.
